//TODO:
//ensure that if a heart container is missed, heart is not lost
//if a heart container is sliced, and heart container life is not full, then heart container count is increased
//make speed range increase over time
//introduce concept of level, every 10 slices level up
//every level up, gain expertise, able to manipulate algebraic expressions on the side
//the more algebra solved, the more intelligence points gained.
//with enough intelligence points, trade in for school grade levels.
//with enough school grade levels, can trade in for acceptance to college.
//when college complete, and enough expertise, you can then upgrade your invisible sword to a visible sword.

//since I can distinguish a heart container from other monsters, then
//          a small monster gains three points
//          darker big monster gains (either 2 points for being dark but large, or 4 points for bigger monster = more bad)

//variable reward based on slice-direction... swipe up gets extra points

//could impliment reward momentum bonus, if points increase # within time period

//would be interesting to increase visibility of monsters some how if streak reaches a certain level
